        <p class="A">
            Hello. My name is Dimitris Klis. I have been interested in programming & computer science ever since 2016, when I started attending robotics lessons.
            As a result, I quickly found out about scratch and started making small games there. In 2019, I stopped attending robotics due to Covid-19. In 2019 I also
            found out about Unity and started googling how to use it. With the help of a lot of YouTube tutorials, growing up and also some people on the social media
            platform 'Discord', I learned how to use Unity without asking for much help. I also learned how to use basic c#. In 2021, I decided to check out python and html,
            and in 2022, I decided to make a basic C# Console app and a C# Windows forms app.
